# ClimateChangeMonitoringProgram
This project was made for my final capstone project in the school. It consists of two parts, the first one is the hardware code, which is a code implemented in an Arduino UNO board as well as an WiFi-Module (ESP8266-01). This code functionality is to retrive the readings of the water temperature sensor, water TDS sensor, and the CO2 gas sensor using the Arduino board, then send it via serial communication to the WiFi-Module, which in turn sends it to a Firebase database as a single string to maintain a high optimization. 
The second part is the C# WPF program, which retrieves the data from the firebase database. The program shows in realtime how the data changes and what are the current values of the data, and can make a real-time graph that increases or decreases in accordance to the data read by the arduino board. Furthermore, the program contains a page for conducting statistical analysis for the data, including the mean, median, mode, variance, correlated, dynamic range, and much more. The program implements a portion of my Machine Learning library made in C#, which is a linear regression model used to see how well data can be correlated with each other.
